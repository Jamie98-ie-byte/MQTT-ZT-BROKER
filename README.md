MQTT-ZT Secure Broker
A lightweight, secure, and extensible MQTT broker designed to implement Zero Trust principles for IoT environments. This project integrates fine-grained access control using Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model with continuous enforcement via XACML.

📌 Features
✅ Lightweight MQTT Broker (based on Moquette)

🔐 Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

📜 XACML Policy Enforcement via Axiomatics PEP SDK (Java)

⛔ Dynamic access revocation on policy violation

🔍 Real-time request evaluation and decision-making

🔒 Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) principles applied

This is a fork for research purposes.
